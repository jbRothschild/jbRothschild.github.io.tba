      <dd><small>The concept of nanoparticle transport through gaps between endothelial cells (inter-endothelial gaps)
        in the tumour blood vessel is a central paradigm in cancer nanomedicine. The size of these gaps was found to be
        up to 2,000 nm. This justified the development of nanoparticles to treat solid tumours as their size is small
         enough to extravasate and access the tumour microenvironment. Here we show that these inter-endothelial gaps
         are not responsible for the transport of nanoparticles into solid tumours. Instead, we found that up to 97% of
         nanoparticles enter tumours using an active process through endothelial cells. This result is derived from
         analysis of four different mouse models, three different types of human tumours, mathematical simulation and
         modelling, and two different types of imaging techniques. These results challenge our current rationale for
         developing cancer nanomedicine and suggest that understanding these active pathways will unlock strategies
         to enhance tumour accumulation </small></dd>

        <dt><b>Effects of cross-talk and pleiotropy on the specificity and accuracy of receptor signaling</b><i>
          Kirby D, <u>Rothschild J</u>, Smart M, Zilman A. arXiv preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05895">arXiv:1911.05895</a> (2019)</i></dt>
        <dd><small>Living cells and cell collectives crucially depend on the ability to sense their environment through engagement of external molecular
          signals with cell surface receptors. Puzzlingly, vast numbers of signaling pathways exhibit a high degree of
          cross-talk between different signals whereby different ligands act through the same receptor or shared components downstream.
          It remains unclear how a cell can accurately process information from the environment in such cross-wired pathways.
          We show that a feature which commonly accompanies cross-talk - receptor pleiotropy (the ability of the receptor to produce multiple outputs)
          - offers a solution to the cross-talk problem. In a minimal model of pleiotropic receptor cross-talk, we show that a single pleiotropic
          receptor is sufficient to simultaneously identify the ligand and accurately sense the concentration of a presented ligand, enabling
          specific and accurate signaling. We calculate the fundamental limits of the signaling specificity and accuracy of a pleiotropic receptor
          arising from the molecular noise both at the receptor level and downstream. We further investigate the effects of common signaling schemes
          such as Kinetic Proofreading (KPR) and show that KPR does not necessarily increase the signaling specificity once the effects of molecular
          noise are taken into account. The model serves as an elementary "building block" towards understanding more complex cross-wired
          receptor-ligand signaling networks, and suggests how cross-talk and pleiotropy might be inherent features of combinatorial
          signaling in cross-wired networks. The results of the paper suggest a novel outlook at a number of experimental systems. </small></dd>

        <dt><b>Predicting Ancestral Segmentation Phenotypes from Drosophila to Anopheles Using In Silico Evolution</b><i>
          <u>Rothschild J</u>, Tsimiklis P, Siggia ED, François P. PLOS Genetics 12(5): e1006052 (2016).
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006052">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006052</a></i></dt>
        <dd><small>Molecular evolution is an established technique for inferring gene homology but regulatory DNA turns over
           so rapidly that inference of ancestral networks is often impossible. In silico evolution is used to compute
           the most parsimonious path in regulatory space for anterior-posterior patterning linking two Dipterian species.
           The expression pattern of gap genes has evolved between Drosophila (fly) and Anopheles (mosquito), yet one of
           their targets, eve, has remained invariant. Our model predicts that stripe 5 in fly disappears and a new posterior
           stripe is created in mosquito, thus eve stripe modules 3+7 and 4+6 in fly are homologous to 3+6 and 4+5 in mosquito.
           We can place Clogmia on this evolutionary pathway and it shares the mosquito homologies. To account for the
           evolution of the other pair-rule genes in the posterior we have to assume that the ancestral Dipterian utilized
           a dynamic method to phase those genes in relation to eve.</small></dd>
